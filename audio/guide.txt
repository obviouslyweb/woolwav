Place any audio files that you want the bot to be able to play in this folder.

If you'd like, you can also place subfolders within the audio folder.
The bot will then search all subfolders when using the /play command.
Should two files have the same name, it'll ask you which one to play.

The bot will ignore any files that don't match the following extensions:
- mp3, wav, ogg, m4a, flac

-------------------- ! WARNING ! --------------------
The bot WILL display the filenames of the files to end users.
Make sure you're OK with others seeing the filenames of the audio you put in here.
